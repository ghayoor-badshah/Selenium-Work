			<p style = "text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:22px;">ORGAN DONOR STATEMENT</p>
			<p>If you marked 'Yes' to register as an organ and tissue donor, you are legally authorizing the recovery of organs and tissues in the event of your death. Registering as a donor will not affect your medical treatment in any way. As outlined in the California Anatomical Gift Act, your authorization is legally binding and, unless the donor is under 18 years of age, your decision does not require the consent of any other person. For registered donors under 18 years of age, the legal guardian shall make the final decision. You may limit your donation to specific organs or tissues, place usage restrictions (for the example transplantation or research), obtain more information about donation, or remove your name from the registry on the website of Donate Life California: <a href ="http://www.donatelifecalifornia.org">www.donateLIFEcalifornia.org</a>. By registering as an Organ Donor, you are giving your consent to allow DMV to electronically transmit your true full name, residence or mailing address, year of birth, and California driver license or identification card number to Donate Life California. By signing this form, you consent to this process and have been notified that this transmittal will occur.</p>
